This repository demonstrates state locking in Terraform using S3 and DynamoDB.

**Contents:**

* `buckets.tf`: Defines an S3 bucket for storing the Terraform state file.
* `providers.tf`: Configures the Terraform provider for AWS.
* `tables.tf`: Creates a DynamoDB table for state locking.

**Prerequisites:**

* An AWS account with appropriate permissions.
* Terraform installed and configured.

**Understanding State Locking:**

State locking is a crucial mechanism in Terraform that prevents concurrent modifications to the Terraform state file. This ensures data integrity and avoids potential corruption.

**How it Works:**

1. **S3 Backend:** The state file is stored in an S3 bucket, providing a reliable and scalable storage solution.
2. **DynamoDB Table:** A DynamoDB table acts as the locking mechanism. When Terraform performs operations that modify the state, it acquires a lock on the corresponding table entry.
3. **Exclusive Access:** This lock ensures that only one Terraform instance can modify the state at a time, preventing conflicts and data corruption.

**Usage:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Awais411/State-locking-terraform.git
   ```

2. **Change directory:**

   ```
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. **Review the configuration:**

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the configuration:**

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

   **Warning:** This will create resources in your AWS account and incur charges.

**Additional Notes:**

* You can modify the configuration files based on your specific requirements.
* Refer to the official AWS documentation for detailed information on S3 and DynamoDB.
